In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management,
and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More
precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values,the relationships
among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT
defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements
the physical form of the data type.
Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of
applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For
example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data
retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables
to look up identifiers.

The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set
of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure.
The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from
those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of
an (abstract data type), a data structure that is defined indirectly by
the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical
properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).
