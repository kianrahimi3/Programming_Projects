My name is Kian Rahimi and I am a transfer student from DCCCD.

The main  community college I went to, out of the many, was North Lake College.
It was about 5 mins from my house.

My experience there was very weird. Though I do believe that I saved a lot of money
and get my pre reqs done rather quickly, I lacked the social skills that I could
be getting at another school

When I was there, everything seemed so bland and boring. It felt like nothing had life.
North Lake was weird.
