The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set
of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure.
The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from
those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of
an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by
the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical
properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).
